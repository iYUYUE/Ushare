User Story
--------------

* One day, Bob was having a class in Science Building A169, but he suddenly found that it was raining outside and he forgot to bring an umbrella. Bob looked around and had no idea who to ask for sharing an umbrella to go to the dormitory. That’s why we plan to design an app to accommodate this situation.

* With our app, people can instantly find companies on their way who are willing to share the umbrella.

Why choose us?

1. Accuracy & Power-saving Ushare uses campus’s wireless network for location service. Our campus has wide wireless network coverage and staff’s devices usually access the nearest AP with strongest signal among numerous hotspots. Having the same access point means they are close enough to each other. Compared with GPS, our design simply keeps track of the BSSID of the AP, users are connected to, without any extra energy loss and it ensures even higher location accuracy.

2. Efficient Ushare can significantly reduce the time for finding the people willing to share umbrella. It provides users (peers) real-time communication. The whole appointment may takes less than 5 minutes (depends on both sides’ response time).

3. Convenient Ushare can accommodate some awkward social situation. Some people may be born shy and afraid of being rejected. They can use this app with ease, because the people they found are all willing to share umbrella.
To sum up, the app we are designing will provide people a chance to help each other. We believe we are capable to make this come true.
